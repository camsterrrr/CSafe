# CSafe, 

## A password manager written in C

Author: Camsterrrr / Cameron Oakley (Oakley.CameronJ@gmail.com)

The idea of this project was sparked as I learned about different programming legends, most of the programmers that I look up to started working on a project that they were passionate about and used there passions to carve out their place in the world. My university, CSU Monterey Bay, doesn't offer an extra curricular programming projects that I could join, so I thought of this project which I could work on by myself. 

This project serves as a way for me to work on a project **by myself** and use all of the concepts built up over my programming tenure. This is in no way the next big password managing application, but it is something that can show that I know how to program and build up a software app. Also, I intend to only use frameworks that are absolutely needed, everything else I plan on programming myself.
