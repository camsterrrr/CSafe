# Agile Goals

This text document is to serve as an unconventional way for me to draft and target agile goals. The whole goal of this project is to try and do everything myslef, so I am taking my approach to tracking goals the same way.

## Users should be able to...



## Administrators should be able to...



## Databases should be able to...



## Attackers should be able to...

- Do nothing!!!
